        <p>As dope as they all seem, not all MYP 3 celebrities always see eye to eye when it comes to friendships. Just like when the Mean girl's character Cady walked into the school cafeteria filled with people split into small groups according to popularity and hobbies: you can now delve into the secret guide into the friend groups of the MYP.3</p>

        <p>The class is divided into 4 main groups, </p>

      <p>Firstly we have the brainiacs; these people are the "Golden Team" or the "skvösts" of the bunch. Will you ever encounter one in between completing their assignments, you will find them on bookstagram, goodreads, or joking about their favourite book characters.</p>

   <p>Secondly we have the Boyos: always wearing a hoodie, they are the only 4 boys in the entire class: so ladies...be fast or all of them will be snatched by other girls soon enough... </p>
  <p>Next we have the Creatives; these people are the artistic wizards and will amaze you with their creative ideas and artworks. </p>

     <p>Last but not least we have the most mysterious group of all. The 8girls. These queens know how to have fun and where to find the best donuts. Each with their own individual fashion style and personality, they are definitely a squad to look out for!</p>
